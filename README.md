When you work, create a branch off of dev named your name or something pertaining to your branch. When major 
milestones are achieved we'll merge into main one.

Check the project folder there's a column for each task whether it's been started, in progress, or done. There is a column for each member. When you accept any task create a card for your column and continually update **YOUR** task card with your progress. Whenever we move the progress card (in any of the three columns of progress) sign off your name at the bottom. If multiple people have the same task, each sign.
