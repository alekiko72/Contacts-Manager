# Contacts-Manager

We'll include all new files and their descriptions here with instructions on how to run the project

When you work, create a branch off of dev named your name or something pertaining to your branch. When major 
milestones are achieved we'll merge into main one. 


Any update to another branch besides your own, **merge requests** fill in the field that asks for additional person to review.

Check the project folder there's a column for each task whether it's been started, in progress, or done. There is a column for each member. When you accept any task create a card for your column and continually update **YOUR** task card with your progress. Whenever we move the progress card (in any of the three columns of progress) sign off your name at the bottom. If multiple people have the same task, each sign.
